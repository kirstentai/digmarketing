This is an analysis of results from a display campaign experiment for my digital marketing class case study.
Because of the massive data, it takes very long and a lot of functions to filter and calculate values via Excel.
Hence, I used Python to filter and process the data from an Excel file and finally write insights from my findings (not included here).
